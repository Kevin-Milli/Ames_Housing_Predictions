# Ames Housing Price Prediction

Description:
This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook showcasing a predictive model for housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various features related to residential properties in Ames, Iowa. The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts housing prices based on these features.

## Introduction:
This project aims to build a predictive model for housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. The dataset contains a rich set of features related to properties, making it an ideal candidate for exploring various machine learning techniques to predict house prices effectively.

## Dataset Overview:
The Ames Housing Dataset includes information about different aspects of residential properties such as lot size, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, year built, and more. It comprises both numerical and categorical features, offering a comprehensive view of each property's characteristics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA involves visualizing and understanding the dataset's key characteristics. Important insights are drawn from data visualizations to identify relationships between features and the target variable, helping to make informed decisions during feature engineering and model building.

## Model Building:
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated using the preprocessed dataset. The notebook includes the implementation of algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, XGboost and ElasticNet, allowing for a comparative analysis of their performance.

## Model Evaluation:
The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure the models' robustness and ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
